# Test notes
There is a Required.t.sol files that defines some stuff for quick access. Also there are few often used helper functions that need to be implemented in each dApp test file.
Another important thing is funding with pair token. While you always can vm.deal for ETH, mint is not always implemented. So you have to find a "pairwhale", generally 1st address from the "holders" tab at block explorer.
